# PROJECT ISSUE TICKET

> Copy and paste the raw MD code of this template, then replace the quote blocks with your detailed, clear descriptions.

## Unexpected Behavior

> I have used useState and UseEffect in  my AddPoemScreen to pull existing poets, and have passed this data as a prop to my AddPoem Component. As I am trying to map through and create a select bar of all existing poets, nothing is rendering to the screen.

## Expected Behavior

> The Select bar should be portraying all current poets using their first and last names.

## Reproduce the Error
